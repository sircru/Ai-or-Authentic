<h3><dt><strong>Unnatural Details or Inconsistencies</strong></dt>
<dd>AI images may have strange or inconsistent details, such as poorly formed hands, fingers, or faces with mismatched eyes or asymmetrical features.
Clothing, jewelry, and other objects may look distorted or lack realism, with odd seams or unrealistic reflections.</dd>
<dt><strong>Blurry or Distorted Areas</strong></dt>
<dd>AI often struggles with creating consistent textures, especially in areas like backgrounds, hair, and skin. 
Look for blurry or poorly detailed parts that don't match the sharpness of other areas.</dd>
<dt><strong>Odd Lighting or Shadows</strong></dt>
<dd>Check if the lighting in the image seems unnatural. In AI images, shadows might be inconsistent or lighting can appear flat and unrealistic.</dd>
<dt><strong>Mismatch Between Foreground and Background</strong></dt>
<dd>In AI-generated images, there could be a disconnect between the subject and the environment, such as objects in the background being too sharp or appearing out of place.</dd>
<dt><strong>Too "Perfect" Appearance</strong></dt>
<dd>AI images might seem overly polished, with perfect skin, flawless symmetry, and no signs of real-world imperfections like wrinkles, scars, or blemishes.</dd>
